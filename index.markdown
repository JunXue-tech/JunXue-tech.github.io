## 🧭 About Me

I'm an AI researcher and engineer currently working at iFLYTEK.  
I received my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Anhui University in 2024, with a focus on fake speech detection.  
My research touches upon invisible attacks, robustness to noise, and lightweight model design.  
I have also participated in EEG-based auditory attention decoding and speech-to-speech translation projects.
